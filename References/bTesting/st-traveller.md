StarTraveller Traveller: an information-organization system for building, running, and playing tabletop RPGs.

============
Introduction
============

ST-Traveller was born out of a desire to make RPG systems more easily navigable and accessible, especially by new players. The primary goal was to design a system to access information that is ore interactive and versatile than reading through a static PDF manual. Hence the design is heavily focused on an information organization structure that is accessible in different ways, depending on who is viewing it and for what purpose. Secondly, it would be nice to allow the information structure to tie in with a community of players, to make the site a true "home base" for the RPG in question. In the broader, long-term scheme of things, it would be nice to have a very feature-rich system, allowing for things like campaign-builders, character-creators, and forums to be integrated with the core RPG information.

Information Structures
======================

The information that comprises a tabletop RPG is divided into two main types: Lore and Game Mechanics. Lore is narrative information that describes the type of world that the RPG is based in. Games Mechanics is concerned with the rules of the game. Some game systems (such as D&D) are primarily concerned with Mechanics, and are abstracted enough apart from the Lore so that the players can construct any type of story they want within those mechanics. Some game systems (eg. World of Darkness) rely more heavily on Lore, so in order to construct and play a Lore-heavy game, the players must invest a significant amount of time engaging with the Lore.

Site has three main user groups:
	1. Game builders (add/access info)
	2. Players - DMs (access info)
	3. Players - PCs (access info)
	4. General public anon (access info and comment)

Origins
=======

The 'ST' in ST-Traveller stands for StarTraveller, a game system developed by Alastair Jaimeson-Lane (plus friends) over many years. The goal of this project, StarTraveller-Traveller, was to make a system for storing, navigating, and using the information that comprises the StarTraveller universe, game mechanics, and lore.
